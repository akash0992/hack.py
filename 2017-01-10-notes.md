# Notes from the session on 2017-01-10

We will follow this approach of maintaining references. 

For each session day, if we want to create note, we will do so in this repo.

Each note will be named as `{DATE in YYYY-MM-DD}-notes.md` like `2017-01-10-notes.md`. 
It will be a markdown file.

To include `code` snippets, we should use below format

```py

def hello_world():
    print 'Hello World!'

```
